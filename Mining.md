# BURST Mining

## Hardware
* 

## Software

### Operating System
* Linux (Ubuntu 16.04)

### Mining Software for Linux (CPU)
* Burstcoin C++ CPU and GPU Miner "creepminer": https://github.com/Creepsky/creepMiner/releases


## Mining Pools
Depending on the mining capacity select one of the following pools (see https://www.ecomine.earth/burstpools)
* 0-100 Pool: 0% for the block finder, 100% historic. This pool is suited for small miner sizes up to 30TB rigs.
* 50-50 Pool: 50% for the block finder, 50% historic. This pool is suited for medium miner sizes with 30TB to 250TB mining rigs.
* 100-0 Pool: 100% for the block finder, 0% historic. This is the "solo miner" pool for large mining rigs > 250TB.

* List of all pools supporting the hard fork: https://ecomine.earth/burstpools
* Burst PoCC Pools (0-100 / 50-50 / 100-0): https://burst.cryptoguru.org

## Mining Procedure Tips

### Read Time
What is the max. acceptable read time for mining?
* Max. read time is 1 minute
* Read time for BEST Performance <30 seconds

And how it can be improved? Which hardware components should I pay attention to?
- CPU threads
- RAM capacity
- HDD technology
- HDD capacity
- HDD interface (SAS or SATA)
- Controller specification (e.g. internal RAM)
- somthink forgotten?
